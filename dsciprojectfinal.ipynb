    "Alcohol consumption is oftentimes involved in activities as a form of bonding and to facilitate socialization, moreover, it can be a part of one's culture. For example, there are \"wet cultures\" where alcohol is common in everyday life, which are in European countries around the Mediterranean and \"consumed with meals\", with lower rates of abstinence. Or, there are \"dry cultures\" where alcohol is uncommon with higher rates of abstinence, such as Canada(Bloomfield et al., 2003). The differences of alcohol in countries have been showed in studies previously. For example, a study found that German respondents had an alcohol consumption that was twice as high as US respondents (Bloomfield et al., 2003)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that excessive consumption of alcohol is linked to many negative health outcomes. It may lead to crimes, road incidents, diseases and health impacts (Ritchie et al., 2018). Alcohol can cause addiction, and after drinking alcohol the effects can persist for hours (Babor et al., 2010). A European longitudinal study also demonstrated that job loss had a positive association with hazardous drinking over the span of 6 years (Bosque-Prous et al., 2015). Thus, one can see the substantial impacts of alcohol consumption on populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis uses data, \"Happiness and Alcohol Consumption\" found on Kaggle.com and will seek to answer the following question: Given the beer, and wine per capita, what regions are would most likely have those consumption per capita?  In this analysis, this expansive dataset was collected by Marcos Pessotto. In our dataset, we will be using the variables: “Region”, “Beer_PerCapita” and “Wine_PerCapita”. For our project, we hypothesize that the higher the beer and wine consumption per capita, it will most likely to be located on the Western Europe region as Western Europe regions borders the Mediterranean, where \"wet culture\" is prevalent(Bloomfield et al., 2003).
